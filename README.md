# hello-world
Hey everyone! My name is Gordon Quach, and I am a student at Virginia Tech majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) and minoring in Entrepreneurship and New Venture Growth (ENVG). I hope to use my programming skills to participate in fun projects, automate the boring things in life, as well as bring a smile to someone's face!
