# hello-world
Hey everyone! My name is Gordon Quach, and I am an Industrial Engineer / Data Analyst within the Defense/Manufacturing industry.

I studied Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) and minoring in Entrepreneurship and New Venture Growth (ENVG) at Virginia Tech. Currently, I am pursuing a Masters in Systems Engineering at University of Maryland, Baltimore County with a concentration in IT Systems and Data Science. 

With experiences in consulting, data analysis, data visualization, strategic planning, automation technology implementation, process improvement, and solution architecting, I aim to deliver value to my teams/stakeholders as well as continue in learning more technology/problem solving techniques!
